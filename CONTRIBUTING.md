## Commit message and Pull Request message

- Follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) to release note automation.
- Don't mention or link that can't accessable from public.
- Use English only. Because this project will be published to the world-wide open-source world. But no worries. We are fully aware of that most of us are not the English-native.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the [README.md](README.md) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Fill out all sections of the pull request template. That makes it easier to review your PR for the reviewers.
4. You may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
