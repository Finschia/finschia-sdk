# Changelog

## Unreleased

## [v0.42.9](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.42.9) - 2021-08-04

### Bug Fixes

* [\#9835](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9835) Moved capability initialization logic to BeginBlocker to fix nondeterminsim issue mentioned in [\#9800](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/9800). Applications must now include the capability module in their BeginBlocker order before any module that uses capabilities gets run.
* [\#9201](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9201) Fixed `<app> init --recover` flag.


### API Breaking Changes

* [\#9835](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9835) The `InitializeAndSeal` API has not changed, however it no longer initializes the in-memory state. `InitMemStore` has been introduced to serve this function, which will be called either in `InitChain` or `BeginBlock` (whichever is first after app start). Nodes may run this version on a network running 0.42.x, however, they must update their app.go files to include the capability module in their begin blockers.

### Client Breaking Changes

* [\#9781](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9781) Improve`withdraw-all-rewards` UX when broadcast mode `async` or `async` is used.

## [v0.42.8](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.42.8) - 2021-07-30

### Features

* [\#9750](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9750) Emit events for tx signature and sequence, so clients can now query txs by signature (`tx.signature='<base64_sig>'`) or by address and sequence combo (`tx.acc_seq='<addr>/<seq>'`).

### Improvements

* (cli) [\#9717](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9717) Added CLI flag `--output json/text` to `tx` cli commands.

### Bug Fixes

* [\#9766](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9766) Fix hardcoded ledger signing algorithm on `keys add` command.

## [v0.42.7](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.42.7) - 2021-07-09

### Improvements

* (baseapp) [\#9578](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9578) Return `Baseapp`'s `trace` value for logging error stack traces.
* (cli) [\#9593](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9593) Check if chain-id is blank before verifying signatures in multisign and error.

### Bug Fixes

* (x/ibc) [\#9640](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9640) Fix IBC Transfer Ack Success event as it was initially emitting opposite value.
* [\#9645](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9645) Use correct Prometheus format for metric labels.
* [\#9299](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9299) Fix `[appd] keys parse cosmos1...` freezing.
* (keyring) [\#9563](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9563) fix keyring kwallet backend when using with empty wallet.
* (x/capability) [\#9392](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9392) initialization fix, which fixes the consensus error when using statesync.


## [v0.42.6](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.42.6) - 2021-06-18

### Improvements

* [\#9428](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9428) Optimize bank InitGenesis. Added `k.initBalances`.
* [\#9429](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9429) Add `cosmos_sdk_version` to node_info
* [\#9541](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9541) Bump tendermint dependency to v0.34.11.

### Bug Fixes

* [\#9385](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9385) Fix IBC `query ibc client header` cli command. Support historical queries for query header/node-state commands.
* [\#9401](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9401) Fixes incorrect export of IBC identifier sequences. Previously, the next identifier sequence for clients/connections/channels was not set during genesis export. This resulted in the next identifiers being generated on the new chain to reuse old identifiers (the sequences began again from 0).
* [\#9408](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9408) Update simapp to use correct default broadcast mode.
* [\#9513](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9513) Fixes testnet CLI command. Testnet now updates the supply in genesis. Previously, when using add-genesis-account and testnet together, inconsistent genesis files would be produced, as only add-genesis-account was updating the supply.
* (x/gov) [\#8813](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8813) fix `GET /cosmos/gov/v1beta1/proposals/{proposal_id}/deposits` to include initial deposit

* [\#9383](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9383) New CLI command `query ibc-transfer escrow-address <port> <channel id>` to get the escrow address for a channel; can be used to then query balance of escrowed tokens
* (baseapp, types) [#\9390](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9390) Add current block header hash to `Context`
* (store) [\#9403](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9403) Add `RefundGas` function to `GasMeter` interface

## [v0.42.5](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.42.5) - 2021-05-18

* [\#9235](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9235) CreateMembershipProof/CreateNonMembershipProof now returns an error
if input key is empty, or input data contains empty key.
* [\#9108](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9108) Fixed the bug with querying multisig account, which is not showing threshold and public_keys.
* [\#9345](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9345) Fix ARM support.
* [\#9040](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9040) Fix ENV variables binding to CLI flags for client config.

### Features

* [\#8953](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8953) Add the `config` CLI subcommand back to the SDK, which saves client-side configuration in a `client.toml` file.


## [v0.42.4](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.42.4) - 2021-04-08

### Client Breaking Changes

* [\#9026](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9026) By default, the `tx sign` and `tx sign-batch` CLI commands use SIGN_MODE_DIRECT to sign transactions for local pubkeys. For multisigs and ledger keys, the default LEGACY_AMINO_JSON is used.

### Bug Fixes

* (gRPC) [\#9015](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9015) Fix invalid status code when accessing gRPC endpoints.
* [\#9026](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9026) Fixed the bug that caused the `gentx` command to fail for Ledger keys.

## [v0.40.0](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.40.0) - 2021-01-08

v0.40.0, known as the Stargate release of the Cosmos SDK, is one of the largest releases
of the Cosmos SDK since launch. Please read through this changelog and [release notes](./RELEASE_NOTES.md) to make
sure you are aware of any relevant breaking changes.

### Client Breaking Changes

* __Modules__

* __CLI__
  * (client/keys) [\#5889](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5889) remove `keys update` command.
  * (x/auth) [\#5844](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5844) `tx sign` command now returns an error when signing is attempted with offline/multisig keys.
  * (x/auth) [\#6108](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6108) `tx sign` command's `--validate-signatures` flag is migrated into a `tx validate-signatures` standalone command.
  * (x/auth) [#7788](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7788) Remove `tx auth` subcommands, all auth subcommands exist as `tx <subcommand>`
  * (x/genutil) [\#6651](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6651) The `gentx` command has been improved. No longer are `--from` and `--name` flags required. Instead, a single argument, `name`, is required which refers to the key pair in the Keyring. In addition, an optional
  `--moniker` flag can be provided to override the moniker found in `config.toml`.
  * (x/upgrade) [#7697](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7697) Rename flag name "--time" to "--upgrade-time", "--info" to "--upgrade-info", to keep it consistent with help message.
* __REST / Queriers__
  * (api) [\#6426](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6426) The ability to start an out-of-process API REST server has now been removed. Instead, the API server is now started in-process along with the application and Tendermint. Configuration options have been added to `app.toml` to enable/disable the API server along with additional HTTP server options.
  * (client) [\#7246](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7246) The rest server endpoint `/swagger-ui/` is replaced by `/swagger/`, and contains swagger documentation for gRPC Gateway routes in addition to legacy REST routes. Swagger API is exposed only if set in `app.toml`.
  * (x/auth) [\#5702](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5702) The `x/auth` querier route has changed from `"acc"` to `"auth"`.
  * (x/bank) [\#5572](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5572) The `/bank/balances/{address}` endpoint now returns all account balances or a single balance by denom when the `denom` query parameter is present.
  * (x/evidence) [\#5952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5952) Remove CLI and REST handlers for querying `x/evidence` parameters.
  * (x/gov) [#6295](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6295) Fix typo in querying governance params.
* __General__
  * (baseapp) [\#6384](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6384) The `Result.Data` is now a Protocol Buffer encoded binary blob of type `TxData`. The `TxData` contains `Data` which contains a list of Protocol Buffer encoded message data and the corresponding message type.
  * (client) [\#5783](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5783) Unify all coins representations on JSON client requests for governance proposals.
  * (crypto) [\#7419](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7419) The SDK doesn't use Tendermint's `crypto.PubKey`
      interface anymore, and uses instead it's own `PubKey` interface, defined in `crypto/types`. Replace all instances of
      `crypto.PubKey` by `cryptotypes.Pubkey`.
  * (store/rootmulti) [\#6390](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6390) Proofs of empty stores are no longer supported.
  * (store/types) [\#5730](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5730) store.types.Cp() is removed in favour of types.CopyBytes().
  * (x/auth) [\#6054](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6054) Remove custom JSON marshaling for base accounts as multsigs cannot be bech32 decoded.
  * (x/auth/vesting) [\#6859](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6859) Custom JSON marshaling of vesting accounts was removed. Vesting accounts are now marshaled using their default proto or amino JSON representation.
  * (x/bank) [\#5785](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5785) In x/bank errors, JSON strings coerced to valid UTF-8 bytes at JSON marshalling time
  are now replaced by human-readable expressions. This change can potentially break compatibility with all those client side tools
  that parse log messages.
  * (x/evidence) [\#7538](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7538) The ABCI's `Result.Data` field for
    `MsgSubmitEvidence` responses does not contain the raw evidence's hash, but the protobuf encoded
    `MsgSubmitEvidenceResponse` struct.
  * (x/gov) [\#7533](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7533) The ABCI's `Result.Data` field for
    `MsgSubmitProposal` responses does not contain a raw binary encoding of the `proposalID`, but the protobuf encoded
    `MsgSubmitSubmitProposalResponse` struct.
  * (x/gov) [\#6859](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6859) `ProposalStatus` and `VoteOption` are now JSON serialized using its protobuf name, so expect names like `PROPOSAL_STATUS_DEPOSIT_PERIOD` as opposed to `DepositPeriod`.
  * (x/staking) [\#7499](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7499) `BondStatus` is now a protobuf `enum` instead
    of an `int32`, and JSON serialized using its protobuf name, so expect names like `BOND_STATUS_UNBONDING` as opposed
    to `Unbonding`.
  * (x/staking) [\#7556](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7556) The ABCI's `Result.Data` field for
    `MsgBeginRedelegate` and `MsgUndelegate` responses does not contain custom binary marshaled `completionTime`, but the
    protobuf encoded `MsgBeginRedelegateResponse` and `MsgUndelegateResponse` structs respectively

### API Breaking Changes

* __Baseapp / Client__
  * (AppModule) [\#7518](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7518) [\#7584](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7584) Rename `AppModule.RegisterQueryServices` to `AppModule.RegisterServices`, as this method now registers multiple services (the gRPC query service and the protobuf Msg service). A `Configurator` struct is used to hold the different services.
  * (baseapp) [\#5865](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5865) The `SimulationResponse` returned from tx simulation is now JSON encoded instead of Amino binary.
  * (client) [\#6290](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6290) `CLIContext` is renamed to `Context`. `Context` and all related methods have been moved from package context to client.
  * (client) [\#6525](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6525) Removed support for `indent` in JSON responses. Clients should consider piping to an external tool such as `jq`.
  * (client) [\#8107](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8107) Renamed `PrintOutput` and `PrintOutputLegacy`
      methods of the `context.Client` object to `PrintProto` and `PrintObjectLegacy`.
  * (client/flags) [\#6632](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6632) Remove NewCompletionCmd(), the function is now available in tendermint.
  * (client/input) [\#5904](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5904) Removal of unnecessary `GetCheckPassword`, `PrintPrefixed` functions.
  * (client/keys) [\#5889](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5889) Rename `NewKeyBaseFromDir()` -> `NewLegacyKeyBaseFromDir()`.
  * (client/keys) [\#5820](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5820/) Removed method CloseDB from Keybase interface.
  * (client/rpc) [\#6290](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6290) `client` package and subdirs reorganization.
  * (client/lcd) [\#6290](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6290) `CliCtx` of struct `RestServer` in package client/lcd has been renamed to `ClientCtx`.
  * (codec) [\#6330](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6330) `codec.RegisterCrypto` has been moved to the `crypto/codec` package and the global `codec.Cdc` Amino instance has been deprecated and moved to the `codec/legacy_global` package.
  * (codec) [\#8080](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8080) Updated the `codec.Marshaler` interface
    * Moved `MarshalAny` and `UnmarshalAny` helper functions to `codec.Marshaler` and renamed to `MarshalInterface` and
      `UnmarshalInterface` respectively. These functions must take interface as a parameter (not a concrete type nor `Any`
      object). Underneath they use `Any` wrapping for correct protobuf serialization.
  * (crypto) [\#6780](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6780) Move ledger code to its own package.
  * (crypto/types/multisig) [\#6373](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6373) `multisig.Multisignature` has been renamed  to `AminoMultisignature`
  * (codec) `*codec.LegacyAmino` is now a wrapper around Amino which provides backwards compatibility with protobuf `Any`. ALL legacy code should use `*codec.LegacyAmino` instead of `*amino.Codec` directly
  * (crypto) [\#5880](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5880) Merge `crypto/keys/mintkey` into `crypto`.
  * (crypto/hd) [\#5904](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5904) `crypto/keys/hd` moved to `crypto/hd`.
  * (crypto/keyring):
    * [\#5866](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5866) Rename `crypto/keys/` to `crypto/keyring/`.
    * [\#5904](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5904) `Keybase` -> `Keyring` interfaces migration. `LegacyKeybase` interface is added in order
  to guarantee limited backward compatibility with the old Keybase interface for the sole purpose of migrating keys across the new keyring backends. `NewLegacy`
  constructor is provided [\#5889](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5889) to allow for smooth migration of keys from the legacy LevelDB based implementation
  to new keyring backends. Plus, the package and the new keyring no longer depends on the sdk.Config singleton. Please consult the [package documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/crypto/keyring/doc.go) for more
  information on how to implement the new `Keyring` interface.
    * [\#5858](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5858) Make Keyring store keys by name and address's hexbytes representation.

  * (types) [\#5579](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5579) The `keepRecent` field has been removed from the `PruningOptions` type.
  The `PruningOptions` type now only includes fields `KeepEvery` and `SnapshotEvery`, where `KeepEvery`
  determines which committed heights are flushed to disk and `SnapshotEvery` determines which of these
  heights are kept after pruning. The `IsValid` method should be called whenever using these options. Methods
  `SnapshotVersion` and `FlushVersion` accept a version arugment and determine if the version should be
  flushed to disk or kept as a snapshot. Note, `KeepRecent` is automatically inferred from the options
  and provided directly the IAVL store.
  * (types) [\#5533](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5533) Refactored `AppModuleBasic` and `AppModuleGenesis`

    is now `Any` in concordance with [ADR 019](docs/architecture/adr-019-protobuf-state-encoding.md) and `GetContent` should now
    be used to retrieve the actual proposal `Content`. Also the `NewMsgSubmitProposal` constructor now may return an `error`
  * (x/ibc) [\#6374](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6374) `VerifyMembership` and `VerifyNonMembership` now take a `specs []string` argument to specify the proof format used for verification. Most SDK chains can simply use `commitmenttypes.GetSDKSpecs()` for this argument.

      removed and replaced instead by `ConsPubKey` (which returns a SDK `cryptotypes.PubKey`) and `TmConsPublicKey` (which
      returns a Tendermint proto PublicKey).
  * (x/staking/types) [\#7447](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/7447) Remove bech32 PubKey support:
    * `ValidatorI` interface update. `GetConsPubKey` renamed to `TmConsPubKey` (consensus public key must be a tendermint key). `TmConsPubKey`, `GetConsAddr` methods return error.

### Improvements
* __Baseapp / Client / REST__
  * (baseapp) [\#6186](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6186) Support emitting events during `AnteHandler` execution.
  * (baseapp) [\#6053](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6053) Customizable panic recovery handling added for `app.runTx()` method (as proposed in the [ADR 22](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/architecture/adr-022-custom-panic-handling.md)). Adds ability for developers to register custom panic handlers extending standard ones.
  * (client) [\#5810](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5810) Added a new `--offline` flag that allows commands to be executed without an
  internet connection. Previously, `--generate-only` served this purpose in addition to only allowing txs to be generated. Now, `--generate-only` solely
  allows txs to be generated without being broadcasted and disallows Keybase use and `--offline` allows the use of Keybase but does not allow any
  functionality that requires an online connection.
  * (cli) [#7764](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7764) Update x/banking and x/crisis InitChain to improve node startup time
  * (client) [\#5856](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5856) Added the possibility to set `--offline` flag with config command.
  * (client) [\#5895](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5895) show config options in the config command's help screen.

  * (x/auth/ante) [\#6040](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6040) `AccountKeeper` interface used for `NewAnteHandler` and handler's decorators to add support of using custom `AccountKeeper` implementations.
  * (x/evidence) [\#5952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5952) Tendermint Consensus parameters can now be changed via parameter change proposals through `x/gov`.
  * (x/evidence) [\#5961](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5961) Add `StoreDecoder` simulation for evidence module.
  * (x/ibc) [\#5948](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5948) Add `InitGenesis` and `ExportGenesis` functions for `ibc` module.
  * (x/ibc-transfer) [\#6871](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6871) Implement [ADR 001 - Coin Source Tracing](./docs/architecture/adr-001-coin-source-tracing.md).
  * (x/staking) [\#6059](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6059) Updated `HistoricalEntries` parameter default to 100.
  * (x/staking) [\#5584](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5584) Add util function `ToTmValidator` that converts a `staking.Validator` type to `*tmtypes.Validator`.
  * (x/staking) [\#6163](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6163) CLI and REST call to unbonding delegations and delegations now accept
  pagination.
  * (x/staking) [\#8178](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8178) Update default historical header number for stargate
* __General__
  * (crypto) [\#7987](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7987) Fix the inconsistency of CryptoCdc, only use
      `codec/legacy.Cdc`.
  * (logging) [\#8072](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/8072) Refactor logging:
    * Use [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) over Tendermint's go-kit logging wrapper.
    * Introduce Tendermint's `--log_format=plain|json` flag. Using format `json` allows for emitting structured JSON
    logs which can be consumed by an external logging facility (e.g. Loggly). Both formats log to STDERR.
    * The existing `--log_level` flag and it's default value now solely relates to the global logging
    level (e.g. `info`, `debug`, etc...) instead of `<module>:<level>`.
  * (rest) [#7649](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7649) Return an unsigned tx in legacy GET /tx endpoint when signature conversion fails
  * (simulation) [\#6002](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6002) Add randomized consensus params into simulation.

  * (SDK) Updated dependencies
    * Updated iavl dependency to v0.15.3
    * Update tendermint to v0.34.1
  * (types) [\#7027](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/7027) `Coin(s)` and `DecCoin(s)` updates:
    * Bump denomination max length to 128
    * Allow uppercase letters and numbers in denominations to support [ADR 001](./docs/architecture/adr-001-coin-source-tracing.md)
    * Added `Validate` function that returns a descriptive error
  * (types) [\#5581](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5581) Add convenience functions {,Must}Bech32ifyAddressBytes.
  * (types/module) [\#5724](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5724) The `types/module` package does no longer depend on `x/simulation`.
  * (types) [\#5585](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5585) IBC additions:
    * `Coin` denomination max lenght has been increased to 32.
    * Added `CapabilityKey` alias for `StoreKey` to match IBC spec.
  * (types/rest) [\#5900](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5900) Add Check*Error function family to spare developers from replicating tons of boilerplate code.
  * (types) [\#6128](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6137) Add `String()` method to `GasMeter`.

    `version --long` output now shows the list of build dependencies and replaced build dependencies.

## [v0.39.1](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.39.1) - 2020-08-11

### Client Breaking

* (x/auth) [\#6861](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6861) Remove public key Bech32 encoding for all account types for JSON serialization, instead relying on direct Amino encoding. In addition, JSON serialization utilizes Amino instead of the Go stdlib, so integers are treated as strings.

### Improvements

* (client) [\#6853](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6853) Add --unsafe-cors flag.

## [v0.39.0](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.39.0) - 2020-07-20

### Improvements

* (deps) Bump IAVL version to [v0.14.0](https://github.com/cosmos/iavl/releases/tag/v0.14.0)
* (client) [\#5585](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5585) `CLIContext` additions:
  * Introduce `QueryABCI` that returns the full `abci.ResponseQuery` with inclusion Merkle proofs.
  * Added `prove` flag for Merkle proof verification.
* (x/staking) [\#6791)](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6791) Close {UBDQueue,RedelegationQueu}Iterator once used.

### API Breaking Changes

* (baseapp) [\#5837](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5837) Transaction simulation now returns a `SimulationResponse` which contains the `GasInfo` and `Result` from the execution.

### Client Breaking Changes

* (x/auth) [\#6745](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6745) Remove BaseAccount's custom JSON {,un}marshalling.

### Bug Fixes

* (store) [\#6475](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6475) Revert IAVL pruning functionality introduced in
[v0.13.0](https://github.com/cosmos/iavl/releases/tag/v0.13.0),
where the IAVL no longer keeps states in-memory in which it flushes periodically. IAVL now commits and
flushes every state to disk as it did pre-v0.13.0. The SDK's multi-store will track and ensure the proper
heights are pruned. The operator can set the pruning options via a `pruning` config via the CLI or
through `app.toml`. The `pruning` flag exposes `default|everything|nothing|custom` as options --
see docs for further details. If the operator chooses `custom`, they may provide granular pruning
options `pruning-keep-recent`, `pruning-keep-every`, and `pruning-interval`. The former two options
dictate how many recent versions are kept on disk and the offset of what versions are kept after that
respectively, and the latter defines the height interval in which versions are deleted in a batch.
**Note, there are some client-facing API breaking changes with regard to IAVL, stores, and pruning settings.**
* (x/distribution) [\#6210](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6210) Register `MsgFundCommunityPool` in distribution amino codec.
* (types) [\#5741](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5741) Prevent `ChainAnteDecorators()` from panicking when empty `AnteDecorator` slice is supplied.
* (baseapp) [\#6306](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/6306) Prevent events emitted by the antehandler from being persisted between transactions.
* (client/keys) [\#5091](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5091) `keys parse` does not honor client app's configuration.
* (x/bank) [\#6674](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6674) Create account if recipient does not exist on handing `MsgMultiSend`.
* (x/auth) [\#6287](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/6287) Fix nonce stuck when sending multiple transactions from an account in a same block.

## [v0.38.5] - 2020-07-02

### Improvements

* (tendermint) Bump Tendermint version to [v0.33.6](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.33.6).

## [v0.38.4] - 2020-05-21

### Bug Fixes

* (x/auth) [\#5950](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5950) Fix `IncrementSequenceDecorator` to use is `IsReCheckTx` instead of `IsCheckTx` to allow account sequence incrementing.

## [v0.38.3] - 2020-04-09

### Improvements

* (tendermint) Bump Tendermint version to [v0.33.3](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.33.3).

## [v0.38.2] - 2020-03-25

### Bug Fixes

* (baseapp) [\#5718](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5718) Remove call to `ctx.BlockGasMeter` during failed message validation which resulted in a panic when the tx execution mode was `CheckTx`.
* (x/genutil) [\#5775](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5775) Fix `ExportGenesis` in `x/genutil` to export default genesis state (`[]`) instead of `null`.
* (client) [\#5618](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5618) Fix crash on the client when the verifier is not set.
* (crypto/keys/mintkey) [\#5823](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5823) fix errors handling in `UnarmorPubKeyBytes` (underlying armoring function's return error was not being checked).
* (x/distribution) [\#5620](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5620) Fix nil pointer deref in distribution tax/reward validation helpers.

### Improvements

* (rest) [\#5648](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5648) Enhance /txs usability:
  * Add `tx.minheight` key to filter transaction with an inclusive minimum block height
  * Add `tx.maxheight` key to filter transaction with an inclusive maximum block height
* (crypto/keys) [\#5739](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5739) Print an error message if the password input failed.

## [v0.38.1] - 2020-02-11

### Improvements

* (modules) [\#5597](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5597) Add `amount` event attribute to the `complete_unbonding`
and `complete_redelegation` events that reflect the total balances of the completed unbondings and redelegations
respectively.

### Bug Fixes

* (types) [\#5579](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5579) The IAVL `Store#Commit` method has been refactored to
delete a flushed version if it is not a snapshot version. The root multi-store now keeps track of `commitInfo` instead
of `types.CommitID`. During `Commit` of the root multi-store, `lastCommitInfo` is updated from the saved state
and is only flushed to disk if it is a snapshot version. During `Query` of the root multi-store, if the request height
is the latest height, we'll use the store's `lastCommitInfo`. Otherwise, we fetch `commitInfo` from disk.
* (x/bank) [\#5531](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5531) Added missing amount event to MsgMultiSend, emitted for each output.
* (x/gov) [\#5622](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5622) Track any events emitted from a proposal's handler upon successful execution.

## [v0.38.0] - 2020-01-23

### State Machine Breaking

* (genesis) [\#5506](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5506) The `x/distribution` genesis state
  now includes `params` instead of individual parameters.
* (genesis) [\#5017](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5017) The `x/genaccounts` module has been
deprecated and all components removed except the `legacy/` package. This requires changes to the
genesis state. Namely, `accounts` now exist under `app_state.auth.accounts`. The corresponding migration
logic has been implemented for v0.38 target version. Applications can migrate via:
`$ {appd} migrate v0.38 genesis.json`.
* (modules) [\#5299](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5299) Handling of `ABCIEvidenceTypeDuplicateVote`
  during `BeginBlock` along with the corresponding parameters (`MaxEvidenceAge`) have moved from the
  `x/slashing` module to the `x/evidence` module.

### API Breaking Changes

* (modules) [\#5506](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5506) Remove individual setters of `x/distribution` parameters. Instead, follow the module spec in getting parameters, setting new value(s) and finally calling `SetParams`.
* (types) [\#5495](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5495) Remove redundant `(Must)Bech32ify*` and `(Must)Get*KeyBech32` functions in favor of `(Must)Bech32ifyPubKey` and `(Must)GetPubKeyFromBech32` respectively, both of which take a `Bech32PubKeyType` (string).
* (types) [\#5430](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5430) `DecCoins#Add` parameter changed from `DecCoins`
to `...DecCoin`, `Coins#Add` parameter changed from `Coins` to `...Coin`.
* (baseapp/types) [\#5421](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5421) The `Error` interface (`types/errors.go`)
has been removed in favor of the concrete type defined in `types/errors/` which implements the standard `error` interface.
  * As a result, the `Handler` and `Querier` implementations now return a standard `error`.
  Within `BaseApp`, `runTx` now returns a `(GasInfo, *Result, error)` tuple and `runMsgs` returns a
  `(*Result, error)` tuple. A reference to a `Result` is now used to indicate success whereas an error
  signals an invalid message or failed message execution. As a result, the fields `Code`, `Codespace`,
  `GasWanted`, and `GasUsed` have been removed the `Result` type. The latter two fields are now found
  in the `GasInfo` type which is always returned regardless of execution outcome.
  * Note to developers: Since all handlers and queriers must now return a standard `error`, the `types/errors/`
  package contains all the relevant and pre-registered errors that you typically work with. A typical
  error returned will look like `sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrUnknownRequest, "...")`. You can retrieve
  relevant ABCI information from the error via `ABCIInfo`.
* (client) [\#5442](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5442) Remove client/alias.go as it's not necessary and
components can be imported directly from the packages.
* (store) [\#4748](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/4748) The `CommitMultiStore` interface
now requires a `SetInterBlockCache` method. Applications that do not wish to support this can simply
have this method perform a no-op.
* (modules) [\#4665](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4665) Refactored `x/gov` module structure and dev-UX:
  * Prepare for module spec integration
  * Update gov keys to use big endian encoding instead of little endian
* (modules) [\#5017](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5017) The `x/genaccounts` module has been deprecated and all components removed except the `legacy/` package.
* [\#4486](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4486) Vesting account types decoupled from the `x/auth` module and now live under `x/auth/vesting`. Applications wishing to use vesting account types must be sure to register types via `RegisterCodec` under the new vesting package.
* [\#4486](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4486) The `NewBaseVestingAccount` constructor returns an error
if the provided arguments are invalid.
* (x/auth) [\#5006](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5006) Modular `AnteHandler` via composable decorators:
  * The `AnteHandler` interface now returns `(newCtx Context, err error)` instead of `(newCtx Context, result sdk.Result, abort bool)`
  * The `NewAnteHandler` function returns an `AnteHandler` function that returns the new `AnteHandler`
  interface and has been moved into the `auth/ante` directory.
  * `ValidateSigCount`, `ValidateMemo`, `ProcessPubKey`, `EnsureSufficientMempoolFee`, and `GetSignBytes`
  have all been removed as public functions.
  * Invalid Signatures may return `InvalidPubKey` instead of `Unauthorized` error, since the transaction
  will first hit `SetPubKeyDecorator` before the `SigVerificationDecorator` runs.
  * `StdTx#GetSignatures` will return an array of just signature byte slices `[][]byte` instead of
  returning an array of `StdSignature` structs. To replicate the old behavior, use the public field
  `StdTx.Signatures` to get back the array of StdSignatures `[]StdSignature`.
* (modules) [\#5299](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5299) `HandleDoubleSign` along with params `MaxEvidenceAge` and `DoubleSignJailEndTime` have moved from the `x/slashing` module to the `x/evidence` module.
* (keys) [\#4941](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4941) Keybase concrete types constructors such as `NewKeyBaseFromDir` and `NewInMemory` now accept optional parameters of type `KeybaseOption`. These
optional parameters are also added on the keys sub-commands functions, which are now public, and allows
these options to be set on the commands or ignored to default to previous behavior.
* [\#5547](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5547) `NewKeyBaseFromHomeFlag` constructor has been removed.
* [\#5439](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5439) Further modularization was done to the `keybase`
package to make it more suitable for use with different key formats and algorithms:
  * The `WithKeygenFunc` function added as a `KeybaseOption` which allows a custom bytes to key
    implementation to be defined when keys are created.
  * The `WithDeriveFunc` function added as a `KeybaseOption` allows custom logic for deriving a key
    from a mnemonic, bip39 password, and HD Path.
  * BIP44 is no longer build into `keybase.CreateAccount()`. It is however the default when using
    the `client/keys` add command.
  * `SupportedAlgos` and `SupportedAlgosLedger` functions return a slice of `SigningAlgo`s that are
    supported by the keybase and the ledger integration respectively.
* (simapp) [\#5419](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5419) The `helpers.GenTx()` now accepts a gas argument.
* (baseapp) [\#5455](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5455) A `sdk.Context` is now passed into the `router.Route()` function.

### Client Breaking Changes

* (rest) [\#5270](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5270) All account types now implement custom JSON serialization.
* (rest) [\#4783](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4783) The balance field in the DelegationResponse type is now sdk.Coin instead of sdk.Int
* (x/auth) [\#5006](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5006) The gas required to pass the `AnteHandler` has
increased significantly due to modular `AnteHandler` support. Increase GasLimit accordingly.
* (rest) [\#5336](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5336) `MsgEditValidator` uses `description` instead of `Description` as a JSON key.
* (keys) [\#5097](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5097) Due to the keybase -> keyring transition, keys need to be migrated. See `keys migrate` command for more info.
* (x/auth) [\#5424](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5424) Drop `decode-tx` command from x/auth/client/cli, duplicate of the `decode` command.

### Features

* (store) [\#5435](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5435) New iterator for paginated requests. Iterator limits DB reads to the range of the requested page.

* (keys) [\#4754](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/4754) Introduce new Keybase implementation that can
leverage operating systems' built-in functionalities to securely store secrets. MacOS users may encounter
the following [issue](https://github.com/keybase/go-keychain/issues/47) with the `go-keychain` library. If
you encounter this issue, you must upgrade your xcode command line tools to version >= `10.2`. You can
upgrade via: `sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools; xcode-select --install`. Verify the
correct version via: `pkgutil --pkg-info=com.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables`.
* [\#5355](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5355) Client commands accept a new `--keyring-backend` option through which users can specify which backend should be used
by the new key store:
  * `os`: use OS default credentials storage (default).
  * `file`: use encrypted file-based store.
  * `kwallet`: use [KDE Wallet](https://utils.kde.org/projects/kwalletmanager/) service.
  * `pass`: use the [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) command line password manager.
  * `test`: use password-less key store. *For testing purposes only. Use it at your own risk.*
* (keys) [\#5097](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5097) New `keys migrate` command to assist users migrate their keys
to the new keyring.

command can delete multiple keys by passing their names as arguments. The aforementioned commands can then be piped together, e.g.
`appcli keys list -n | xargs appcli keys delete`
* (modules) [\#4233](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/4233) Add upgrade module that coordinates software upgrades of live chains.
* [\#4486](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/4486) Introduce new `PeriodicVestingAccount` vesting account type
that allows for arbitrary vesting periods.
* (baseapp) [\#5196](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5196) Baseapp has a new `runTxModeReCheck` to allow applications to skip expensive and unnecessary re-checking of transactions.
* (types) [\#5196](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5196) Context has new `IsRecheckTx() bool` and `WithIsReCheckTx(bool) Context` methods to to be used in the `AnteHandler`.
* (x/auth/ante) [\#5196](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5196) AnteDecorators have been updated to avoid unnecessary checks when `ctx.IsReCheckTx() == true`
* (x/auth) [\#5006](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5006) Modular `AnteHandler` via composable decorators:
  * The `AnteDecorator` interface has been introduced to allow users to implement modular `AnteHandler`
  functionality that can be composed together to create a single `AnteHandler` rather than implementing
  a custom `AnteHandler` completely from scratch, where each `AnteDecorator` allows for custom behavior in
  tightly defined and logically isolated manner. These custom `AnteDecorator` can then be chained together
  with default `AnteDecorator` or third-party `AnteDecorator` to create a modularized `AnteHandler`
  which will run each `AnteDecorator` in the order specified in `ChainAnteDecorators`. For details
  on the new architecture, refer to the [ADR](docs/architecture/adr-010-modular-antehandler.md).
  * `ChainAnteDecorators` function has been introduced to take in a list of `AnteDecorators` and chain
  them in sequence and return a single `AnteHandler`:
    * `SetUpContextDecorator`: Sets `GasMeter` in context and creates defer clause to recover from any
    `OutOfGas` panics in future AnteDecorators and return `OutOfGas` error to `BaseApp`. It MUST be the
    first `AnteDecorator` in the chain for any application that uses gas (or another one that sets the gas meter).
    * `ValidateBasicDecorator`: Calls tx.ValidateBasic and returns any non-nil error.
    * `ValidateMemoDecorator`: Validates tx memo with application parameters and returns any non-nil error.
    * `ConsumeGasTxSizeDecorator`: Consumes gas proportional to the tx size based on application parameters.
    * `MempoolFeeDecorator`: Checks if fee is above local mempool `minFee` parameter during `CheckTx`.
    * `DeductFeeDecorator`: Deducts the `FeeAmount` from first signer of the transaction.
    * `SetPubKeyDecorator`: Sets pubkey of account in any account that does not already have pubkey saved in state machine.
    * `SigGasConsumeDecorator`: Consume parameter-defined amount of gas for each signature.
    * `SigVerificationDecorator`: Verify each signature is valid, return if there is an error.
    * `ValidateSigCountDecorator`: Validate the number of signatures in tx based on app-parameters.
    * `IncrementSequenceDecorator`: Increments the account sequence for each signer to prevent replay attacks.
* (cli) [\#5223](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5223) Cosmos Ledger App v2.0.0 is now supported. The changes are backwards compatible and App v1.5.x is still supported.
* (x/staking) [\#5380](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5380) Introduced ability to store historical info entries in staking keeper, allows applications to introspect specified number of past headers and validator sets
  * Introduces new parameter `HistoricalEntries` which allows applications to determine how many recent historical info entries they want to persist in store. Default value is 0.
  * Introduces cli commands and rest routes to query historical information at a given height
* (modules) [\#5249](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5249) Funds are now allowed to be directly sent to the community pool (via the distribution module account).

* (keys) [\#5439](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5439) Flags `--algo` and `--hd-path` are added to
  `keys add` command in order to make use of keybase modularized. By default, it uses (0, 0) bip44
  HD path and secp256k1 keys, so is non-breaking.
* (types) [\#5447](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5447) Added `ApproxRoot` function to sdk.Decimal type in order to get the nth root for a decimal number, where n is a positive integer.
  * An `ApproxSqrt` function was also added for convenience around the common case of n=2.

* (cli) [\#5116](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/5116) The `CLIContext` now supports multiple verifiers
when connecting to multiple chains. The connecting chain's `CLIContext` will have to have the correct
chain ID and node URI or client set. To use a `CLIContext` with a verifier for another chain:
  ```go
  // main or parent chain (chain as if you're running without IBC)
  mainCtx := context.NewCLIContext()

  // connecting IBC chain
  sideCtx := context.NewCLIContext().
    WithChainID(sideChainID).
    WithNodeURI(sideChainNodeURI) // or .WithClient(...)

  sideCtx = sideCtx.WithVerifier(
    context.CreateVerifier(sideCtx, context.DefaultVerifierCacheSize),

to detail this new feature and how state transitions occur.
* (docs/spec) All module specs moved into their respective module dir in x/ (i.e. docs/spec/staking -->> x/staking/spec)
* (docs/) [\#5379](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/5379) Major documentation refactor, including:
